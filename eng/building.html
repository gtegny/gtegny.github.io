										I decided to develop my own SCADA / BEMS to reduce the license fees during my building project with my partner company. <br />
										Developing my own system will also allow to simplify the installation of the server and to create custom functionalities such as 
										implementation of AI algorithm<br />
										I decided to create a Golang server for its high concurrency capabilities and I am designing a kafka based micro-services architecture.<br />
										<br />
										This project is an internal project of my startup and has no deadline; I can only spend a limited time for its implementation.

										<h2>Monitoring and control system for negative pressure rooms</h2>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">TegnyTech - For Uiwang health center, South Korea</p>

										<br/>
										Due to rising COVID-19, Uiwang decided to create a new testing center with 2 high negative pressure rooms for sampling and negative hall for medical staffs.<br />
										This system includes 2 main AHU with automation to build (PLC based), up to 12 CAVs and VAVs to monitor and control to achieve the required pressure difference requirements.
										Communication between the different devices use MODBUS RTU/TCP and BACnet IP.<br/>
										I was in charge, with my partner company, of the design and commissioning of the negative pressure system as well as heating / cooling system.
										I worked on all the communication and supervision parts as well as the logics, and my partner developed the local controllers.<br />
										We checked the hardwares installation and did the commissioning together on site.<br />

										<h4>Automation points</h4>
										<p>
											The automation panels for AHUs contain a PLC for temperature sensors reading, control and reading of valve and damper using PID algorithnms.
											The PLC receives also status of the CHU and the room controllers to adjust its setpoints, but also converts this value from 
											MODBUS RTU to a MODBUS TCP or BACNET IPconnection with the main BEMS.<br/>
											CHUs had their own custom made controller made by my partner and allows local control of air flow and air temperature. 
											The CHUs received also the temperature and fans control mode via proprietary protocol from the room controllers.
										</p>
										<h4>Building management system</h4>
										<p>
											I used the Schneider Electric BEMS system to read the different equipements statuses via MODBUS TCP and BACnet IP.
											I also created graphic UI, that are accessible via a webpage, to monitor and control all setpoints in the system:<br/>
											Main chiller mode and setpoints, OHUs control mode / fan speed / temperature setpoints / alarms, CHUs fan speed / temperature setpoints, main control mode (auto or manual).

										<h2>Heating / cooling ventilation system for Hospital 9 floor</h2>

										<span class="image left" style="width: 300px;"><img src="assets/images/none.jpg" alt="Uiwang prj" /></span>
										<br />
										The goal of the project was the designed and implementation of a new hospital 9 floors building ventilation system.<br/>
										The ventilation system contains 19 OHUs, 18 EHUs, up to 190 CHUs that we created. We also integrate 20 FCUs and 1 Heating pump for water cooling / heating,
										from external companies, into the monitoring and control system.<br />
										The system allows the easy monitoring and control of every devices via technical graphic user interface, but also contains more user friendly floorplan type 
										graphics that shows real time statuses of each floors and rooms in the hospital.<br/>
										The system runs autonomously with the different room control setpoints, air quality measurements and Season mode. Control of setpoints by scheduling is also available
										 as well as manual overwritting and alarming system.
										<br />
										<br />
										I worked on this project with my company in collaboration with my partner company and his customer.<br />
										I designed and built the 19 OHUs automation panels, all the graphic interfaces and control programs as well as set all the communications via the different devices.<br />
										I worked 6 months at his office in Seoul, then we checked the hardwares installation, did the communication wiring and the commissioning together on site.<br />

										<h4>Automation points</h4>
										<p>
											I designed and build 19 automation panels for the control of the OHUs. It contains power converters, connection terminals, relays and a PLC.
											The PLC received temperature sensors values, Air quality information via MODBUS RTU, CHUs and FCUs statuses via MODBUS RTU, Differential pressure value for filter status.
											It controls via PIDs the air damper position, cooled/heated water valve, CHUs & FCUs temperature and fan speed, control mode of the heating pump.<br/>
											The room controllers controls the temperature setpoints and fan speed of the local CHUs device, created by my partner company.
											An air quality multi-sensor device, created by my partner company, was installed on a specific floor.<br/>
											All the devices were connected to the main BEMS installed in the basement on 1 computer. The CHUs, the air quality monitoring device and EHUs were connected to the OHU PLC via MODBUS RTU, 
											the OHU PLCs were connected to the BEMS via BACnet IP, the external FCUs and the heating pump were connected to the BEMS via MODBUS TCP.

										<h2>Schneider Electric Healthcare Building segment: Global solution demonstration used worldwide </h2>

										The Ecostruxure Healthcare demo is a marketing platform and application that shows the integration of the different Schneider Electric products 
										for every level of decision for the healthcare sector: Hospital building management and Pharmaceutical factories. Instead of video and static documents 
										this set of interconnected virtual machines run the real Schneider Electric product and simulate the control of a realistic hospital and show the response 
										of the system to real scenario.
										<br />
										<br />
										I worked on this project with the Global Solution Architect, responsible for the segment worldwide. The Global solution architect defined the project and scenario, 
										and I coded all the GUI with svg graphics and JavaScript interactive components, algorithm via block logics and scripts also the communication to integrate the others software.<br />
										We checked the hardwares installation and did the commissioning together on site.<br />
										I saw this demonstration be used even 7 years after its creation in automation fair at the COEX in Seoul.
